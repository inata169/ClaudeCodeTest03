# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal repository (ClaudeCodeTest03) that currently contains only a basic README.md file. The codebase structure and development commands will need to be established as the project grows.

## Current State

- Repository is initialized with git
- Contains only README.md with project title
- No package management files, build scripts, or source code present yet
- No established development workflow or commands

## Next Steps for Development

When code is added to this repository, this CLAUDE.md should be updated to include:
- Build and development commands
- Code architecture and structure
- Testing procedures
- Any project-specific conventions or patterns
